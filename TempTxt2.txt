[ ]ScanFolders
	#scan files and folders, their metadata filenames, filepaths, quantity, size, type and so on. a building block to building a data frame or map. also providing the user with a multiple options of outputs to choose from.  

[ ]FlattenFolders 
	#strategicly uses iterative methods and recursively travers through deeply nested folder structures removing any files found and routing them to a user chosen destination

[ ]CloneCatcher
	#a duplicate file finder that traverses from its designated root folder and folder and sub-folder, scanning each file for potential duplicates comparing size, file type, file name, and hashes. Providing a number of choices for how duplicates should be dealt with. example: move duplicates to specific destination (chosen by user or created), delete duplicates, or only log duplicates(a log will be created with every choice provided)(list options that will be show if selected)   
	#option 1 -move duplicates to specific destination?
		#option 1.1 -file path(mnt/c/Users/Cindy/Desktop/Duplicates
	#option 2 -delete duplicates
	#option 3 -only log duplicates 
[ }RenameFiles
	#Process string module, which uses a pattern learning algorithm to sort file name and a find key words, patterns, deriving meaning, while creating a dictionary or log of all it's findings. a data frame showing a how files can be renamed or organized or broken down and renamed. 

#Continue with a list of all the other available functions described throughout the examples I gave you. Add some of your own if you'd like. 

#When it comes to a workflow, imagine the user has selected to use every possible function. using up-to-date methods "best practices" must come into play on workflow, logic, and other considerations that I couldn't possibly acknowledge in a single prompt. but you could. as I was saying. imagine the user has chosen every single function, and it had to be in a certain order so that one function didn't contradict the following function what would make the most sense? Then if that cycle has been perfected than when removing the functions shouldn't be an issue. remember that this process cant be completely processed until all the functions have been determined so only focus on the listing functions for now.

# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive file processing system that allows users to select input options, choose tools, and specify output preferences. The system is built using Google Apps Script, Python, and various libraries and frameworks.

---

## GUI Overview

The GUI is a user-friendly interface that allows users to select input options, choose tools, and specify output preferences. It is built using Google Apps Script's built-in UI service, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

---

## How it Works

The GUI consists of 5 pages, with 3 of them (sections 1-3) displaying in an accordion-style transition:

1. **Input Preferences (Section 1)**
2. **Tool Selection (Section 2)**
3. **Output Preferences (Section 3)**
4. **OAuth2 and Privacy Disclaimer (pop-up)**
5. **Final Submission (Confirmation page)**

Users can select input options, choose tools, and specify output preferences in sections 1-3. The GUI will automatically trigger the OAuth2 and privacy disclaimer pop-ups when necessary, and once filled in properly, they will not pop up again.

---

## Setup and Integration

### Google Apps Script Setup

1. Create a new Google Apps Script project.
2. Create a new HTML file called `index.html` and paste the contents from this repository.
3. Create HTML files for each section:
   - `input-preferences.html`
   - `tool-selection.html`
   - `output-preferences.html`
4. Create a new CSS file called `styles.css` and paste the contents from this repository.
5. Create a new JavaScript file called `script.js` and paste the contents from this repository.
6. In the Google Apps Script editor, create a new script file called `Code.gs`.
7. Paste the contents of `Code.gs` from this repository into the new script file.
8. Deploy the script as a web app:
   - Go to `Publish > Deploy as web app`.
9. Set up the OAuth2 and privacy disclaimer pop-ups by following the instructions below.

---

## OAuth2 and Privacy Disclaimer

### Setup Instructions:

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and create a new OAuth2 client ID.
2. In the Google Apps Script editor, enable the Google Drive API:
   - `Resources > Advanced Google services`
3. In `Code.gs`, replace the `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` and `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` placeholders with your actual client ID and secret.
4. Deploy the script again (`Publish > Deploy as web app`).

---

## Python Components

The Python components are responsible for processing user input and generating output. They are built using various libraries, including:

- `google-api-python-client` for interacting with the Google Drive API
- `google-auth` for OAuth2 authentication
- `google-auth-oauthlib` for OAuth2 authorization
- `flask` for building the web application

### Setup Instructions:

1. Install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

#### Developer vision 
The chat/user interface should be interactive, a number of preliminary questions should be formed to establish primary tools that will be used in this process example: 
File Managagment y/n 
Audio y/n
Video y/n
Database y/n
Swarm Agency y/n
Custom Recipe (one time customization script) y/n

  Data extracted at anypoint can be used or added to improve output detai

## ASSISTANT
The project you provided details about is designed to automate the processing and analysis of various communication records stored in Google Drive, including voice, text, Facebook Messenger, and voicemail records. The system extracts key information from the file names using pattern recognition and custom logic, and then organizes this data in a Google Sheet.

### Key Components:

1. **Project Manager (Time-driven trigger)**:
   - Orchestrates the entire process.
   - Manages the batch processing of files.
   - Implements a heartbeat mechanism to detect and handle potential script hangs.

2. **File Analyst (Processing script)**:
   - Retrieves batches of files from a specified Google Drive folder.
   - Analyzes the file names to extract relevant information (like name, date/time, type, and source).
   - Structures the extracted data and appends it to a designated Google Sheet.

3. **Data Organizer (Spreadsheet trigger)**:
   - Reacts to changes in the output spreadsheet.
   - Performs additional tasks or calculations based on new data.
   - Ensures data integrity and organization.

### Workflow:
- The "Project Manager" initiates the process at scheduled intervals, retrieves a batch of files, and hands them over to the "File Analyst".
- The "File Analyst" analyzes each file’s name to extract key details and appends the data to the Google Sheet.
- The "Data Organizer" performs additional processing whenever new data appears in the spreadsheet.
- The "Project Manager" continues to oversee the process, managing batches and ensuring smooth operation.

### Filename Patterns:
The system is customized to recognize specific filename patterns, extracting relevant details such as names, dates, and communication types. Examples of filenames include:
- "Kara's Home Phone (206) 473-0764) (phone) 2021-10-20 14-02-38.json"
- "Zoom meeting (zoom) 2022-06-11 18-18-33.amr"
- "William Sparky - Missed -2023-11-03T19_20_2OZ.html"

### Scripts:
- **Project Manager Script**: Handles file retrieval and initiates file analysis, including a heartbeat check.
- **File Analyst Script**: Analyzes the file names, extracts relevant data, and appends it to the Google Sheet.
- **Data Organizer Script**: Organizes the data within the Google Sheet and performs additional tasks.
- **Filename Analysis Function**: Extracts information like name, date/time, type, source, and file type from filenames.

If you have any specific questions about this project or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

## USER
Please review carefully and make sure logic employs sophisticated method for analysis, has no error, code is correct.  (correct indentation, no duplicate or redundant lines etc). Edit the file again if necessary. Show complete code when finished, ask questions right now if you have any.

## ASSISTANT
I'll review the provided code for logic, sophistication, potential errors, and correct formatting. Let's start by analyzing each section, ensuring that the logic is sound and that the code follows best practices.

### Code Review:

#### 1. **Project Manager Script**

- **Logic**: The script retrieves files from a Google Drive folder and processes them in batches. It then passes these batches to the `fileAnalyst` function.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: This is supposed to monitor the process and detect potential script hangs. However, the implementation for `checkHeartbeat` is missing.

#### 2. **File Analyst Script**

- **Logic**: This script processes each file by extracting relevant information from the filename and appending the data to a Google Sheet.
- **Improvements**: The `analyzeFileName` function could be made more sophisticated by using regular expressions and additional error handling.

#### 3. **Data Organizer Script**

- **Logic**: This script reacts to changes in the Google Sheet and performs additional tasks. However, the specific tasks are not defined, and the trigger creation logic could be improved.

#### 4. **Filename Analysis Logic**

- **Logic**: This function uses regular expressions to extract data from filenames. The logic is generally sound, but it can be improved for edge cases.

I'll make improvements and corrections to ensure the code is robust, sophisticated, and error-free.

## ASSISTANT
continuing with the explanation of the key changes and improvements:

1. **Error Handling**: 
   - Added more comprehensive logging in the `analyzeFileName` function to handle cases where expected patterns (like `dateTime`, `name`, `type`, `source`) might not be found in the filename.
   - Ensured that the `fileAnalyst` function only processes batches of files when files are actually retrieved.

2. **Heartbeat Mechanism**:
   - Implemented a basic heartbeat mechanism in the `checkHeartbeat` function that logs the last execution time and updates it with each run. This provides a simple way to track the health of the process.

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Added a basic sorting operation in the `dataOrganizer` function that sorts the sheet by the `Date/Time` column after new data is added. This ensures that the data remains organized.

4. **Test Function**:
   - Improved the `testAnalyzeFileName` function by ensuring it logs detailed output for each test filename, making it easier to verify that the `analyzeFileName` function is working as expected.

I understand not every file name gives enough information to fill in every column. Custom logic must be implemented. Consider more intelligent approach. Free to ask questions about "outside of the box" logic


## ASSISTANT
To address the issue of incomplete data in filenames and improve the extraction logic, we can introduce more sophisticated and flexible methods. These methods will involve the following enhancements:

### 1. **Default Handling and Assumptions:**
   - When certain information (like `type` or `source`) is missing from the filename, we can apply default assumptions based on patterns or use the file type to infer possible values.

### 2. **Intelligent Guessing:**
   - We can develop a heuristic approach that guesses missing information based on other available data or file type. For example, if the filename is an `.mp3`, it might be a voice recording, so we could infer it as a `phone` source.

### 3. **Pattern Recognition Enhancements:**
   - We can improve regular expression patterns to capture a broader range of possible inputs. This includes more flexible handling of separators (like underscores or spaces) and recognizing common patterns.

### 4. **Fallback Mechanisms:**
   - Implement a fallback mechanism where, if a filename lacks certain data, it defaults to a broader category or prompts for manual review later.

### 5. **Keyword Matching:**
   - Implement keyword matching for common words in filenames that could indicate the type or source (e.g., "call", "text", "voicemail").

### Revised Logic Implementation:

```javascript
// Enhanced Analyze file names to extract relevant information
function analyzeFileName(fileName) {
    let name = '';
    let dateTime = '';
    let type = 'unknown';  // Default to 'unknown' if type not found
    let source = 'unknown';  // Default to 'unknown' if source not found
    let fileType = '';

    // Extract file type
    const fileTypeMatch = fileName.match(/\.\w+$/);
    if (fileTypeMatch) {
        fileType = fileTypeMatch[0];
    }

    // Extract date and time
    const dateTimeMatch = fileName.match(/\d{4}[-_]\d{2}[-_]\d{2}[-_T]\d{2}[-_]\d{2}[-_]\d{2}/);
    if (dateTimeMatch) {
        dateTime = dateTimeMatch[0].replace(/[-_T]/g, ' ');
    } else {
        Logger.log('DateTime not found in file name: ' + fileName);
    }

    // Extract name/phone/email
    const nameMatch = fileName.match(/^[\w\s'()+-]+/);
    if (nameMatch) {
        name = nameMatch[0].trim();
    } else {
        Logger.log('Name/Phone/Email not found in file name: ' + fileName);
    }

    // Intelligent guessing for type and source if not explicitly mentioned
    if (/call|phone|mp3|amr/i.test(fileName)) {
        source = 'phone';
        type = 'call';
    } else if (/facebook/i.test(fileName)) {
        source = 'facebook';
        type = 'social';
    } else if (/zoom/i.test(fileName)) {
        source = 'zoom';
        type = 'meeting';
    } else if (/voicemail/i.test(fileName)) {
        source = 'voicemail';
        type = 'message';
    }

    // Apply regular expressions for specific keywords (type/source)
    const typeMatch = fileName.match(/(inbound|outbound|missed|received|placed|text|call|voicemail)/i);
    if (typeMatch) {
        type = typeMatch[0].toLowerCase();
    }

    const sourceMatch = fileName.match(/(phone|facebook|zoom|email|voicemail)/i);
    if (sourceMatch) {
        source = sourceMatch[0].toLowerCase();
    }

    // Log cases where type/source remains 'unknown'
    if (type === 'unknown') {
        Logger.log('Type not identified: ' + fileName);
    }
    if (source === 'unknown') {
        Logger.log('Source not identified: ' + fileName);
    }

    return { name, dateTime, type, source, fileType };
}
```

### Explanation of the Changes:
1. **Defaults and Intelligent Guessing**:
   - Default values (`unknown`) are used when certain data isn't found, and intelligent guessing based on common patterns (like file type or keywords) fills in likely values.

2. **Improved Pattern Matching**:
   - More flexible regex patterns were added to capture a broader range of filename variations, especially for common communication types like phone calls, Facebook messages, etc.

3. **Heuristic-based Fallbacks**:
   - If a filename lacks specific details, we infer the `type` and `source` from other clues, such as file type or common keywords.

4. **Logging for Unidentified Data**:
   - Cases where data couldn't be extracted are logged for manual review, ensuring that these cases can be handled appropriately later.

### Potential Next Steps:
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing a machine learning model that could learn from existing data to predict missing fields with better accuracy.
- **Manual Review Queue**: Set up a system where files with missing or uncertain data are flagged for manual review.
- **Pattern Expansion**: Continuously expand pattern recognition logic based on observed filename trends.The first step in creating an app with GPT Pilot is writing a project description that will lay out the foundation for GPT Pilot to break down the app development into tasks and then divide each task into smaller steps. Almost every LLM conversation GPT Pilot does starts with the project description so that the LLM has a high level overview of the app it's writing the code for.

#### A Good Project Description
This is why a good project description will make it much easier for GPT Pilot to build your app from start to finish. A poorly written description might also lead to a fully developed application, but it will make it much harder for GPT Pilot to create individual features and will take much longer for the app to be developed. That is why more time spent on writing a good description will save you a lot of time down the road.

Here are some guidelines you can follow while writing a description:
- Write the description as thoroughly as possible, but don't write up every little feature. Think of a project description as a description for your app's MVP (Minimum Viable Product). Write up the minimum set of features you could look at and say, ok, this is a good starting point for my app that I can share with people to check out my app. Then, after your initial project is done, GPT Pilot will ask you if you want to add any new features, and you'll be able to improve your app and add new features continuously.
- Start with high level overview and then zoom in to the specific features
- if it needs to connect to an external API or a database that's not public, explain how to use the API / database


## Here are some examples of good project descriptions:
### SQLite db analysis tool
> I want to create an app that will enable the user to view and analyze the data stored in an SQLite database. On the frontend, the user should first either select the previously uploaded database from the dropdown or upload a new SQLite database by selecting the file from the disk that they want to load. If they choose a new database file from the disk, they should be able to name this database, and the database file should be sent to the backend and stored for later so that the user doesn’t have to upload the database every time they want to analyze it. Once the database is uploaded, the user should be able to interact with it. Specifically, the user should be able to see all apps from the database. Once they choose an app, they should see all development tasks of that app and be able to select one. Once they select a development task, they should see all development steps within the selected development task. Finally, once they select the development step, they should see all the step data from the database.
> 
> The SQLite database will always be structured like this:
> Table “app” contains all apps stored in the database. Every app has multiple development tasks that are stored as an array in the table “development_planning” under the key “development_plan”. Each array item is a JSON object that has 3 key-value pairs: “description”, “user_review_goal” and “programming_goal”.
> Finally, each development task contains many development steps that are stored in the table “development_steps” and are linked to the app table by the key “app_id”. The problem is that there is no connection between the development task and development step so what needs to be done is take all development steps from the database and split the list of steps by the field “prompt_path”. Every development task begins with the prompt path with the value “development/task/breakdown.prompt” so you can connect development steps to development tasks by splitting development steps list in multiple smaller lists in which every smaller list begins with the step that has “prompt_path” equal to “development/task/breakdown.prompt”. That way, you will get development steps for each development task.
> Finally, each development step contains the following values that need to be shown on the frontend to the user: “prompt_path” which is a string, “messages” which is an array of JSON objects, “llm_response” which is a JSON object and “prompt_data” which is JSON object. “messages” array will always contain JSON objects with keys “content” and “role” so the user should see on the frontend a big text field for the value of “content” and a label for the value “role”. “llm_response” will always have a key “text” that should be shown on the frontend as a text area - it will contain a large string. “prompt_data” can have different keys and each key-value pair should be shown to the user.

### Prompt Engineering App
> I want to create an app that will enable me to analyse different responses from OpenAI API. The interface should contain an LLM conversation one main list of messages to the LLM. Each list item should contain a text field where I can add a big text message and a dropdown that selects if the message is from Assistant or User. There can be infinite number of these list items so there can be only one when the app loads and a button to add new list item. Other than the list, there should be a field that contains a number that the user can edit but it can go only from 0 to 100 and also there should be a button SUBMIT. When I click on the SUBMIT button, the LLM conversation should be sent to the OpenAI API, in parallel, X number of times which is the 0 - 100 number that the user added on the frontend. When the responses are fetched from the OpenAI API, there should be a list of expandable elements that, when expanded, show that particular response from the OpenAI API. For example, if I set the number of requests to 10, when the responses start coming, 10 elements should appear that have just the number of the request as a label and when expanded, they should show that specific response. Keep in mind that the OpenAI API returns a stream so it should stream to the frontend as well. Use Tailwind for styling but don’t install it - instead use the CDN version.

### Credits Billing System
> I have an app that enables people to scrape the web and now, I want to create an account management system for my app. Here are the parts of the system I need you to create:
> 1. Authentication. I need the users to be able to register and log in. Make sure that they can reset their password, log out and when a user logs in, that they are logged in for 1 year (use JWT for session management and make sure that the user stays logged in after the server restarts).
> 2. Credit-based billing with Stripe. The user should be able to add a credit card that can be charged. The billing system will incorporate three pricing tiers: a free tier for 0-5000 credits, a Small Business tier priced at $0.0018 per credit for the following 500,000 credits, and an Enterprise tier at $0.0009 per credit for subsequent usage. Billing will be prepaid so that the user will purchase a certain number of credits that will be used up until there are no more credits in the user account - then, the user needs to top up their credits to continue using our service.
> 3. Once the user logs in, they should see their account management with the following pages:
>     - “Dashboard” page that shows their API key and the credits that they used up in the last 1 day, last 7 days and last 30 days. Create an endpoint that will enable another microservice (the one that scrapes the web) to update the used credits for a user. Also, on 
>     - “Billing” page that shows the past invoices and a form that enables user to set up auto-replenish feature. If this feature is turned on, the user will automatically be billed once they go below a certain number of credits. This form should have one toggle that enables or disables this feature and 2 input fields. One input field shows the number of credits to automatically purchase (default to 5000) and the second input field shows a threshold of available credits under which the automatic top up will be triggered. For example, if the threshold is 30000 and the number of credits to automatically purchase is 5000, user will be automatically billed for 5000 credits once their account has less than 30000 credits available. Also, on this page, show a list of all purchases that the user has made and next to each purchase, there should be a button to download a receipt for that purchase.
>     - “Contact” page that shows only an email where users can send their inquiries.
>     - “API Info” page that only shows the API key of the user.
>     - “Buy credits” page that enables users to purchase more credits. This page should have 4 buttons with some common number of credits that users purchase (5000, 25000, 50000, and 100000 credits) and an input field where users can set a custom number of credits to purchase. Below, there should be a field that shows the total price for the selected credits and a button “Confirm” that will trigger a purchase. When the button is clicked, the user is sent to a Stripe page where they can enter their credit card details and pay.
> 4. Frontend styling - use bootstrap for the styling and make sure that there is a sidebar with links to each of the pages listed and a header that shows the user that is logged in and a button to log out.

### Time tracker

> Time-tracking web app for freelancers in node/express using MongoDB. For the UI, use Bootstrap and vanilla JS.
>
> Users must register (username + password, no email verification, no password recovery). Use session-based auth (no JWT).
>
> When user logs in, the home page shows "start" button and input field for task description. When the user enters the description and presses "start", the timer starts, the timer button switches to "stop" and elapsed time (0h0m0s, updated every second) is shown. When the user hits "stop", the time entry is saved to the database, the description field and elapsed time are reset and the timer button switches back to "start". There should be no simultaneous multiple entries for the same user.
>
> The home page also shows 10 most recent time entries and a "Show all" link to the separate "Reports" page.
>
> The reports page has a list of all time entries for a specific date range. The user can select start and stop date (assume from midnight to midnight, time zones can be ignored, always assume local time), default is current month (month to date). When the user changes the time entries and clicks "show", the list of entries is updated as per the selection. The reports page should also show a simple bar chart of time per day, with days in the selected range on the X axis, and total time per day on the Y axis. The reports page should also support downloading the list of time entries in CSV format with "date", "start_time", "stop_time", and "description" columns.  Use 24h format for start-time and end time, and use "YYYY-MM-DD" format for the date.  Always assume local timezone (ignore timezones).
>
> Different users are completely separate (each only sees their own data), no need for multiple roles, admins, etc. Users can edit and delete time entries after they're saved to the database (only on the main page, not in the Reports page).
>
> Use the following project structure:
> 
> * main file should be called `server.js`
> * all database models should be in `models/` directory
> * all routes that respond with HTML should be in `routes/` directory
> * all API endpoints (routes that take and/or respond with JSON and are used by frontend JS) should be in `routes/api/` directory.
> * all templates should be in `views/` directory - use EJS as a template language.
> * all configuration parameters (port, session secret, database url) should be defined in `env` file and loaded via `dotenv`.
> 
> The UI must be simple, responsive, have header (with text logo, and navbar for page navigation and logout). Use Boostrap for styling.
